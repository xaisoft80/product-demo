<h3><u>Privacy Policy</u></h3>
<p>These Terms include the terms and conditions of Derive’s <a href="/umbraco/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy.</a> Accordingly, by using this Site, you affirmatively acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of Derive’s <a href="/umbraco/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy.</a></p>
<h3><u>Taxes</u></h3>
<p>In states where Derive has no physical presence, Derive is not required to collect and remit &nbsp;sales tax for Products and Services purchased through the Site. However, many states require that their residents file a sales or use tax return for Products or services purchased online. You should consult your state and local tax laws to determine compliance with tax laws and regulations in your geographic area. In some states, Derive collects and remits sales tax. For purchases where sales tax is applicable, the tax calculated will be reflected on the checkout page before you are asked to confirm the purchase. Derive uses commercially reasonable efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, but Derive does not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax Derive represents to you as the tax owed. Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple taxing districts, state and local “tax holidays,” the timing of rate changes or the application of certain</p>
<p>taxes to categories of items advertised on this Site. As a result of any error, Derive may over collect or under collect the tax. In consideration of Derive allowing you access to and use of the Site, and in collecting and remitting taxes required on your purchases, you hereby waive your right to claim that the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold harmless Derive, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (and those of its affiliates), for any harm or other damages you may incur as a result of Derive’s error in calculating the taxes on your purchases.</p>

<h3><u>Currency Converter</u></h3>
<p>If a currency converter is available on the Site, the following terms and conditions apply: Currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as &nbsp;guidelines</p>
<p>only. Rates are not verified as accurate, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes are not updated every day. Check the date on the currency converter feature for the day that currency was last updated. The information supplied by the currency converter application is believed to be accurate, but the Derive, the Derive Affiliates, and/or our respective suppliers do not warrant or guarantee such accuracy. When using this information for any financial purpose, we advise you to consult a qualified professional to verify the accuracy of the currency exchange rates. We do not authorize the use of this information for any purpose other than your &nbsp;personal use and you are expressly prohibited from the resale, redistribution, and use of this information for commercial purposes.</p>
<h3><u>Bank And Credit Card Fees</u></h3>
<p>Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a purchase from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the order summary page for a purchase on this Site. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
